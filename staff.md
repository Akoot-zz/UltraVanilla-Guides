### The Rules
*Contrary to popular belief, breaking the rules is **not allowed**! If you see someone breaking the rules, please act accordingly. Before you throw down the mighty hand of the law on someone, consider the following:*
* **Play time:** Be a lot harder on newer players than people who have been playing for a while.
* **Fame/Notoriety:** Consider mistakes/misunderstandings. If someone who is normally nice and friendly and they somehow end up breaking a rule, let them know privately, discuss their actions before taking any drastic measures. 

### Penalties
* **Hacking or exploits:** Absolutely no hacking allowed, exploits however are a gray area. If it is debatable whether it should be allowed, check this handbook or ask *Akoot* personally. Flying, walking on water, spamming etc. will result in an **instaban** if the player is new, and with an **insta *ban*** if they are old (do not get them mixed up).
* **Griefing or stealing:** Griefing is of course not allowed, however, there are special cases where players might have permission from other players to take/build/destroy in their territory. If a player is offline and it is unclear whether a grief happened, be patient, try to contact them via discord, and make sure you have all the relevant facts.
* **Non-Consensual PVP:** If someone is constantly killing someone when it is clear they do not want to fight, warn first, then kick. If necessary, ban them.
* **NSFW builds or excessive explicit language:** Sometimes you might find *a big dirt PP* in the middle of nowhere and wonder to yourself "why". Not something I want happening in __my house__, so I expect you to take care of this issue posthaste! People also sometimes like to be overly sexual and explicit in chat. It is ok to say something but if it is so constant and persistent and off putting, a mute, kick, or ban is acceptable.
* **Spam:** Spamming is discouraged but it is not the biggest deal. Obviously, if someone is spamming with bots that is an automatic ban, but if someone just goes off the goop sometimes in the chat, it happens! Give a warning, mute or kick them. If they persist that warrants a ban.
* **Alt accounts:** Having multiple accounts is not allowed in the case that they are used for something like playing with one while the other one AFKs. You can have an alt account if you use it for a completely different experience on the server (usually in secret). If you think someone is unlawfully using an alt account, ask them first, and if they persist then proceed to ban.
* **Evading AFK kick:** In the case that the server is full, you are encouraged to kick any player who is AFK. People may evade by creating AFK machines (useless) or by auto-joining. I do not think many people will do this but just so you know, it is not allowed.

### Allowed Exploits
* AFK farming
  * Includes fishing, and XP grinding (auto-click (as long as it is a realistic click speed))
* Breaking bedrock
