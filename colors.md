## Minecraft 1.16 is out and besides the nether and a lot of neat things they have added RGB COLOR!
#### So I've been working hard on making that possible for us country folk.

First things first, for custom colors the only format accepted by the server will be in **hexadecimal**. If you don't know what that is I recommend you use [this site](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp "this site") or look up "color picker" on google or something.

What your color should be in this format: `#000000` and the 0's can be any number or letter from `0-9` and `a-f`. Capitalization is ignored.

### Here's how you do color text in game:
**Single Colors:** `&#ff0000TEST` will result in a red TEST, and so on. Just think of it like using color codes such as &a but instead of 'a' just replace it with a custom color. Must contain the # or it won't work.

**Gradients:** `&>#ff0000+#00ff00TEST` will the text "TEST" have a gradient from left to right from this color `#ff0000` to this color `#00ff00`.

If you want to use color codes instead you may, as well as color names such as `dark_green` and `aqua`. You can also mix and match such as: `&>red+#0000ff` and `&>c+3` and `&>gold+4` etc. Here's a guide for [color codes](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php "color codes") if you want to use those too.

**Nicknames:** You may use this format as well, but if you simply want a 2-color name, a 2-color gradient (if you have permission), or even just a 1-color name, I recommend using `/namecolor` instead (`/nc` for short).

#### The syntax for `/namecolor` has changed slightly. There's 3 different ways to use this command.

**Single color:** `/namecolor color` This can be any one color such as `red` or `#ff0000`. 
Example: `/namecolor red` or `/namecolor #66d9ff `

**Gradient:** `/namecolor color1+color2` Just put a `+` between 2 colors to give your name a gradient.
Example: `/namecolor #c299ff+black` or `/namecolor red+white`

**Two-color:** `/namecolor color1+color2 na+me` The first part is selecting 2 colors combining them with a `+` then the second part is specifying where in your name you want to make the split.
Example: `/namecolor green+yellow no+tch` or `/namecolor #b3b300+#5c5cd6 jeb+_` the `+` symbol stating that everything to the left of it will be the first color and everything to the right of it will be the second color. **The second argument MUST match your username or current nickname (without color) otherwise you must use /nick if you have permission.**
